# HelloYarn

Trying out the new Yarn package manager. If you already have npm installed, you can just run

`npm install --global yarn`

to get Yarn. The project uses ES6 and React, so you'll need to install dependencies with

`yarn`

in the root of the project. Lastly, since we have Webpack as a dependency we can start the server with

`./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`

and head to `localhost:8080` to see the site.
